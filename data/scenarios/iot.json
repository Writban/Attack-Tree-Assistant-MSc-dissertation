  "guideText": "A smart home camera streams live video to a mobile app and stores short clips in the cloud. When the phone is on the same home Wi-Fi, the app may also use a simple local interface for low-latency streaming. The camera is installed by a typical household and connected to their home Wi-Fi network.\n\nYour task: describe how a person who is not the owner could view the camera’s live feed for several minutes without being noticed. Think about everyday weaknesses rather than deep technical flaws.\n\nAssumptions:\n• The camera account uses email + password; some users reuse passwords across services.\n• The home Wi-Fi uses a printed passphrase on the router; some households never change defaults. WPS may be enabled.\n• Some cameras expose a basic local stream or admin page on the home network if credentials are weak or unchanged.\n• No physical theft or damage of the device.\n\nModel the situation as an attack tree from the goal (“View live camera feed”) down to concrete actions or conditions.",
