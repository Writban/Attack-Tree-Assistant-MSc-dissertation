  "goal": "Access a student account",
  "brief": "Goal: Access a student account without permission.\n\nA university portal lets students view grades, fees, and personal details. Accounts are email-based with password login. A \"Forgot password\" flow sends a reset link to the student’s email. Some students reuse passwords across sites. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) may be optional or set to \"remember this device\".\n\nTask: Build an attack tree that shows realistic ways an attacker could access a student account. Use OR for alternatives and AND when multiple conditions must all be true.\n\nAssumptions:\n• Attacker is external and uses a normal browser.\n• Some students reuse or choose weak passwords.\n• Email accounts may be poorly secured (e.g., reused password, shared device still signed in).\n• Helpdesk may reset passwords if given convincing details.",
  "guideText": "Goal (root): Access a student account.\n\nContext:\n• Login uses email + password; Forgot-password emails contain a reset link.\n• Some users reuse passwords; some set weak or common passwords.\n• MFA may be off, optional, or remembered on trusted devices.\n• Support/helpdesk can reset passwords after verifying identity.\n\nModel routes like:\n• Reuse a leaked/reused password to log in directly (no MFA), OR use a remembered device.\n• Trigger Forgot-password and capture the reset link by accessing the student’s email (reused email password, shared PC left signed in, or guessed mail link if exposed).\n• Social-engineer support to reset the password to attacker-controlled credentials.\n• Bypass MFA via backup/one-time codes, remembered device, or push fatigue.\n\nOut of scope: breaking cryptography, internal DB dumps, malware on university servers.",
