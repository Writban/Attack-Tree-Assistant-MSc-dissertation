  "brief": "Some company documents are shared as 'Anyone with the link can view'. Model how a private document link could be accessed by the wrong person.",
  "guideText": "A company sometimes shares documents by sending a URL where “Anyone with the link can view”. The intention is that only the intended recipients have the link, but viewing is not restricted to specific accounts.\n\nYour task: describe how a person who was not meant to see a particular internal document could still obtain the link and open it in a browser. Focus on realistic ways links spread or can be rediscovered; you do not need to assume deep software flaws.\n\nAssumptions:\n• People occasionally paste document links into emails, tickets, or chat rooms.\n• Filenames and folder names may follow predictable project naming patterns and dates.\n• Some shared computers remain signed in to corporate accounts or keep browser history.\n• No insider willingly hands over the document on request; no hacking the storage provider.\n\nModel the situation as an attack tree from the goal (“Access a private document”) down to concrete actions or conditions.",
